# music-visualiser
visualiser and music player for creators


# why?
the listening experience of people is very different from making experience. This is at least my understanding as someone who has learnt music on his own and is trying to integrate listening to producing.

# what?
users can select bands which they want to analyse in the visualiser and whether it will be logarithmic or linear. It will help build sonic understanding of professional tracks in terms of lows, mid-lows, mids, highs.
